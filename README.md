# Symbian-Open-Source
For one short year, Nokia open-sourced their Symbian smartphone operating system. This is an archive of most of the symbian.org website from December 2010. Included are MediaWiki dumps, Mercurial repository bundles, mailing list archives, and webforum crawls.

The filenames have been transformed systematically, for greater cross-platform consistency.

code_MCL,sftools,depl,swconfigapps,sysmodeltools.hg.bundle , for example, should be extracted to a Mercurial archive named code/MCL/sftools/depl/swconfigapps/sysmodeltools/
